the symbols data of xe.txt is from http://www.xe.com/symbols.php

that data is also used by the c++ currencies thing whose url i can't find (think
it was a wikipedia bottom of the page link somewhere).

after extracting the symbols, manually (as i can't find the data anywhere) add
where (left or right) the associated symbol goes.  often the purported symbols
are actually abbreviations and go on the right, or are not even used at all in
the first place.
